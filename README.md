# Fork of Sunsynk-Power-Flow-Card for users of Huawei and iStore (Australia)

## Purpose
Providing support for Huawei iStore (Australia) inverter and battery users (using WLCRS Integration for HA) using the Sunsynk Power Flow Card.
Any issues re the example derived sensor files, and electricity cost yaml files can be raised upon this repository, where updates shall be made prior to their them being merged into the main Sunsynk site. 

As such all [examples files](https://github.com/Roving-Ronin/sunsynk-power-flow-card/tree/master/docs/examples/huawei_packages) to be used for Huawei / iStore with Sunsynk, at this are to be considered pre-release (beta) versions, whilst the ones on the Sunsynk site are release versions.


The main site for the SunSynk card is located at: [wiki](https://github.com/slipx06/sunsynk-power-flow-card/wiki) for other integration methods and (release) examples.
